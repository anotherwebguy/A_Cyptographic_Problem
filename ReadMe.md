# A Cryptographic Problem
----

## Problem:
- Given an Encrypted message which doesn't make any sense, use some cipher technique to produce the Decrypted message for the receiver to undertand.
- <b>Hint: </b>Each letter of a given word in the sentence is replaced by a letter with a fixed number of positions up/down the alphabet sequence.

----

## Useful resources:
- For checking the meaning of a text whether it makes any sense you can use the below api by making an get request in the below format:
  ```
  https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/<word>
  ```
  [Documentation-DictionaryApi](https://dictionaryapi.dev/)
- Take input from the [EncryptedMessage.txt](https://github.com/anotherwebguy/A_Cyptographic_Problem/blob/main/EncryptedMessage.txt) for fetching the Encrypted text that you have to decrpt using your code or create your own input Encrypted Message.

## Contribution Guidelines:

1. Make sure to follow the same folder structure.
2. When working on your solution, create a folder in the format ``` <username>_<language> ``` and your code goes inside this folder.
3. If you came up with multiple approaches, then make sub-folders as approach_1, approach_2, ... and your code goes inside those sub-folders.
4. Maintain a uniform naming convention throughout your solution.

Contributions are always welcome!ðŸ«¶
